                Recent advances in satellite technology have enabled frequent, high-resolution, and global-scale monitoring of the Earth. 
                This explosion in the availability of Earth Observation (EO) data presents unprecedented opportunities to support critical societal challenges.
                Artificial Intelligence, knowledge graphs, and semantic technologies are emerging as powerful enablers for bridging the gap between raw EO data and actionable insights.
            </p>
            <p class="text-muted">
                LTEOI-2025 will walk participants through the full pipeline of building intelligent EO services—from ingesting raw satellite data to creating responsive, 
                natural language-powered applications. The event is hands-on, enabling participants to learn by doing, while also offering a 
                blueprint that can be replicated across other regions and domains.

            <h2 class="fw-bold display-6">Detailed Description of the Event</h2>
            <p class="text-muted">
                The tutorial will cover tools and methodologies to transform raw EO data into semi-structured RDF data which can be easily and efficiently queried by both novice and expert users.  
                Although the tutorial will be grounded in a use case focused on France, the methodologies and tools presented are generalizable to EO scenarios across domains and geographies.
            </p>
            <h5>Part 1: From Unstructured EO Data to RDF with Python</h5>
            <p class="text-muted">
                Participants will begin by taking raw Earth Observation datasets (satellite images with accompanying metadata) and converting them into RDF format using a simple ontology. This transformation is performed using a custom semantic parsing library developed by our group, capable of extracting structured knowledge from unstructured EO data.
                <br>
                <strong>Tools:</strong> Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 parsing library in Python.
            </p>
            <h5>Part 2: Storing and Querying RDF Data with GraphDB</h5>
            <p class="text-muted">
                The newly-formed RDF data, along with geospatial data concerning administrative divisions and natural features, is loaded into GraphDB. In addition to the built-in GeoSPARQL support, we present a plug-in for supporting stSPARQL. These extensions allow the representation and querying of geometries (points, polygons, etc.) using geospatial functions, making GraphDB ideal for storing Earth observation data with spatial dimensions.
                <br>
                <strong>Tools:</strong> <a href="https://graphdb.ontotext.com/">GraphDB</a>, <a href="https://github.com/SKefalidis/graphdb-geosparql-stsparql-plugin/">stSPARQL extension</a>.
            </p>
            <h5>Part 3: Natural Language Interface by employing TerraQ-as-a-Service</h5>
            <p class="text-muted">
                Now that the RDF knowledge graph is operational, participants will integrate TerraQ, a Text-to-SPARQL system which provides a natural language interface for RDF stores. It does so by translating natural language questions into semantically equivalent SPARQL queries.  TerraQ is a Question-Answering engine that simplifies interaction with EO data, by removing the need for users to understand SPARQL.  As a result, EO data is made more easily accessible to users, while maintaining accuracy and computational efficiency.

            <h5>Part 4: Visualizing Geospatial Results with Leaflet.js</h5>
            <p class="text-muted">
                Until now, results are presented in a raw, CSV-like format. When dealing with satellite image data, it is of paramount importance to be able to see the images, and their visualizations on a map. 
                We show how such functionality can be implemented using Leaflet.js, a lightweight and interactive JavaScript library for mapping. 
                <br>
                <strong>Tools:</strong> <a href="https://leafletjs.com/">Leaflet.js</a>

            <h5>Part 5: Query execution optimization with JedAI-Spatial and GoST</h5>
            <p class="text-muted">
                For the last part of our tutorial we showcase the complexity of geospatial calculations when using large polygons. This results in long response times, making our system frustrating to use. 
                To deal with this we employ geospatial interlinking and query rewriting to dramatically speed-up query execution.

        <p class="text-muted fst-italic">
            <strong>Note:</strong> Participants are encouraged to bring their own laptops to the event. This will enable them to follow along hands-on during the tutorial sessions and execute the code in real-time. 
            Runnable code checkpoints will be provided a few days before the event to ensure that participants can easily set up their environments and follow the tutorial without any issues.
